Active Badge system :


The Active Badge system from the Olivetti Research Lab from the beginning of the 90's is generally considered to be one of the first context-aware applications. With the system persons could be located in an office and calls forwarded to the closest phone. The office personnel wore badges that transmitted IR-signals (so-called active badges). A network of sensors placed around the office building picked up the signals and a central location server polled these sensors. The telephone receptionist could find out where a person was and direct the call to an appropriate phone. Experiments with automatic phone call forwarding were also conducted, but due to the proprietary nature of PBXs it was not possible to create a comprehensive solution. The system also included commands to obtain the current location of a badge, to find out which other badges were in immediate proximity to a named badge, to find out which badges were currently near a specified location, to notify when a badge was again traceable, and a possibility to obtain information where the badge had been during an one-hour period.
